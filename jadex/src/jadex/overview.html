Jadex is a BDI reasoning engine,
which means that it aims at simplifying the task of writing autonomous and intelligent
software agents. The term reasoning engine stems from the fact that Jadex is
conceptually independent of the underlying system infrastructure (since version 0.94)
that is responsible for services like message passing.
Currently, we provide Jadex for three different infrastructures: JADE, Standalone and DIET(experimental).
One main advantage of this separation between agent behaviour and infrastructure
is that Jadex agents can be defined in an abstract way independent of the underlying
infrastructure making them usable in very different environments. Such environments
may range from typical agent infrastructures such as JADE to component-oriented
environments such as J2EE.
