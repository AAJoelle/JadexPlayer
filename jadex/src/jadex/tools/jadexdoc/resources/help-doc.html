How This ADF Documentation Is Organized</H1>
</CENTER>
This ADF (Agent Description File) documentation has pages corresponding to the items in the navigation bar, described as follows.<H3>
Overview</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The <em>Overview</em> page is the front page of this ADF documentation and provides a list of all packages.  This page can also contain an overall description of the set of packages.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>
Package</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Each package has a page that contains a list of its agents and capabilities, with a summary for each. This page can contain two categories:<UL>
<LI>Capabilities (italic)<LI>Agents</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>
Agent/Capability</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Each agent and capability has its own separate page. Each of these pages has three sections consisting of a agent/capability description, summary tables, and detailed member descriptions:<UL>
<LI>Contained Capability diagram<LI>Direct Known Containing Agents<LI>Direct Known Containing Capabilities<LI>Agent/Capability declaration<LI>Agent/Capability description
<P>
<LI>Belief Summary<LI>Goal Summary<LI>Plan Summary<LI>Event Summary<LI>Expression Summary
<P>
<LI>Belief Detail<LI>Goal Detail<LI>Plan Detail<LI>Event Detail<LI>Expression Detail</UL>
Each summary entry contains the first sentence from the detailed description for that item. The summary entries are alphabetical, while the detailed descriptions are in the order they appear in the source code. This preserves the logical groupings established by the programmer.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>
Tree (Agent/Capability Hierarchy)</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is a <em>Tree</em> page for all packages, plus a tree page for each package. Each hierarchy page contains a list of agents and a list of capabilities. The agents are organized by containing structure. The capabilities by contained structure.<UL>
<LI>When viewing the Overview page, clicking on "Tree" displays the hierarchy for all packages.<LI>When viewing a particular package, agent or capability page, clicking "Tree" displays the hierarchy for only that package.</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
